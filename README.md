# Optimus

In this project, I implemented gradient descent, momentum, adagrad, adam, and accelerated gradient with hyperparameter tuning. I optimized the Booth, Beale, Rosenbrock, and Ackley functions, finding solutions with Euclidean distance $< 10^{-10}$ to analytic solution. Note that answer.py was provided to me, the notebook served as a template where I wrote the optimization algorithms, and the report is completely written by me
